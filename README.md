# Machine Learning guide 🤓💻
In this repository we will go through main and basic machine learning constructs and applications using projects, examples, important math theory (we love math ❤️) and a lot of creativity!!

## Guide
These are the topics we will face, with their relative applications:

- ML Tools
- Models:
  - Supervised
  - Unsupervised

A more accurate table of contents can be found in contents.file

## Project structure 📑
Each one of the models will be explored in a dedicated project; every project will follow the same structure, defined in proj_example.file

## Warning ⚠️
This repository will not cover the basic definitions such as "function", "matrix", "loss" ...but will assume them in order to skip directly to the main machine learning models and their applications.
