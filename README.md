# Machine Learning Basics ü§ìüíª
In this repository we will go through main and basic machine learning applications using projects, examples, important math theory (we love math ‚ù§Ô∏è) and a lot of creativity!!

## Guide
These are the models we will face, with their relative applications:
- Supervised Models:
 - Regression:
    - linear
    - Polynomial
    - logistic
 - Classification:
    - binomial
    - multinomial
    - non-parametric
 - 


## Project structure üìë
Each one of the models will be explored in a dedicated project; every project will follow the same structure, defined in proj_example

## Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è
This repository will not cover the basic definitions such as "function", "matrix", "loss" ...but will assume them in order to skip directly to the main machine learning models and their applications.
